            <h1>This are six of the most impactant NBA players of history</h1>
            <h4>When asked when teams started using group chats, the players and coaches agreed that it was around 2014 or 2015.

                “Even over the past five years, communication among players has shifted so much to text messaging, video calls and social media,” one NBA coach said. “It’s really, really phone-based. The smart coaches understand it and they’re the ones who are embracing it. Some coaches try to push back against it, but their players often end up resenting them.”
                
                College teams started implementing group texts around the same time. RJay Barsh is an assistant coach at Boise State University who also trains NBA players in the offseason. He was previously the head coach at Southeastern University, which is where he was coaching when he became a fan of group chats.
                
                “For me, it started in 2015,” Barsh said. “That’s when I was like, ‘Yo, this is the way to go.’ I noticed that players were already communicating through group chats, so it just made a lot of sense for us to use it too. I also liked that even if you switched phones, you could just download the app again and you’re back in your group chat.” “When the iPhone came out and took over, the way we communicated as a society changed,” said a Western Conference coach. “Phone calls became less frequent and everyone shifted to text messaging. It got the point where digital communication sort of replaced interpersonal communication. Then, there was the emergence of emojis and GIFs. As a result, the way that teams communicate changed drastically too.”

                Many NBA teams use iMessage for their group chats, according to the players we surveyed, although there are some organizations that use other messaging apps. When players make their own group chats on the side, it’s typically over iMessage or they’ll create a group direct message on Twitter or Instagram.
                
                “There are many messaging options; it all comes down to preference,” said Cody Toppert, an assistant coach with the Memphis Tigers who was on the Phoenix Suns’ coaching staff last year. “GroupMe is used by a lot of teams, and I like it because you can see who has or hasn’t read your message. Some teams use WhatsApp (especially overseas teams). There’s also Teamworks, which is a team-focused messaging app. Last year, when I was with the Suns, we tried several of the apps, but our players were having trouble getting our messages for whatever reason, so we went old-school and would just send group texts over iMessage. That ended up being the most successful group-chat option for us. Jamal Crawford still has a BlackBerry, so we couldn’t include him on the group texts and had to send everything to him in a separate text, which I thought was hilarious (laughs).”
                
                “My teams have always used GroupMe,” Barsh said. “I think a lot of teams use GroupMe simply because it’s free right now.”</h4>
